# Media-Company-Assignment
This markdown file explains the functionality of the program in analysing advertising data for marketing purposes. The program should run on any data with the same file and column names substituted for the sample data. The program analyses ads where data on impressions, clicks and conversions is collected for a media company. This program can be run and this markdown file can be followed to produced real time analysis for anyone in the company who may want to carry out advertising analysis.

## Running of the program
When the program is run, it can be done in its entirety. i.e. Select All -> Conrol Enter. Before running, check to ensure that the packages in the R file are correctly installed and loaded in. The files need to be in the correct enviroment and imported into the program for the analysis to run. To display tables of the new dataframes created, click on the dataframe in the righthand side of the program under 'Enviroment'. The plots can be viewed in the display under 'Plots' on the right hand side of the program and easily manouvered through with the left and right arrow to find any of the graphs. At any stage, the tables and plots can be called in the console for a faster search. The program is ran under various headings and is structured as follows;

### Import libraries
    The libraries should be available, when installed and called correctly, as is in the file.

### Import datasets
    The datasets should imported, as shown in the R file. Then, view(dataset) should allow you to view the dataset and clarify if it has been done so correctly

### Check for missing data
    The sample dataset did not have any missing data, but it is good to check for any data gaps. The dataset tested will probably be much larger than the sample dataset, so it is best to check at the begining of the project for any possible set backs.

### Convert input to to count
*    The input in impressions, clicks and conversions were converted to count for analysis purposes, to perform calculations.

### Use joins to amalgamate the datasets
*    All of this data was joined into one table, so that the end user may look at any calculations in the one table. It also helped in the production of various graphs later on.

### Remove n/a values
*    Some of the conversions had no counts and appeared n/a, which was converted to 0. This was done as it allowed the graphs to be produced more successfully and became more visually pleasing.

### Click Through Rate
*    Click through rate is the ratio of users who clicked over the total users who viewed(impressions). It is commonly used to measure the degree of success in the online advertising industry.

### Cost Per Impression
*    Cost per impression is a calculation which shows how much an advertiser pays per display. This is an extremely important calculation in the real world, as many companies want to know what benefits they are getting from their payments. The calculation in this case is budget over impressions.

### Cost Per Click
*    Cost per click is similar, it calculates how much the advertiser pays per click. Similarly, this too is extremely important and can be examined under many variables.

### Cost Per Conversion
*    Finally, cost per conversion calculates how much sales or subscriptions the company makes due to these advertisements, whatever the case may be.

### Create index from budget
*    Index was created for budget to keep the format of them the same using id.

### Imputation(cpc)
*    From the sample data, the inifinite values were making the data difficult to analyse, substitute with max

### Removed infinite for various analysis purposes (cpc)
*    Substitute the max value of cost per clicks for infinite values, so that some analysis can be done

### Plot density (cpc)
*    Plot the density of the distribution for the cost per click with the new data that functions correctly.

### Plot density as histogram (cpc)
*    The same plot as above, but this time in different form which may be useful for different analysis.

### Cumulative probability(emperical cumulative density function)(cpc)
*    Calculates the cumulative probabilities and plots each of them for cost per click.

### Add cumulative probabilities to table (cpc)
*    Add the calculations made on the cpc on the cumulative probability to the main table. The higher percentage the better result.
